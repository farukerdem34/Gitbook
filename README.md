# Hello!

## What's this?

This is just a compilation of notes and knowledge I gained from scouring the Internet, self-practicing, going for courses, interning and learning from college. Also serves as a small portfolio for me.&#x20;

### Basic Knowledge

I wrote these when starting my journey in Infosec. It covers stuff that is more beginner-friendly to intermediate level.&#x20;

#### CTF:

#### Web Vulnerabilities:

#### Active Directory & Kerberos:

### Writeups

Here's the writeups to machines I've done on HTB or PGP, and it is the **main bulk** of content here.&#x20;

#### HackTheBox:

#### Proving Grounds Practice:

### In-Depth

Some of the stuff I've picked up from interning with red / pentesting teams, as well as my own research and courses done. A bit more technical and less friendly, but still the same fun.

#### Defence Evasion:

#### Red Teaming and Emulation:

This book will be updated as frequently as I can while juggling school work. Check the Updates page to see what I've added (categorised by month) and the To Add page to see what I plan to add.

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security or pentesting. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.
