# Hello!

This is just a compilation of notes and knowledge I gained from scouring the Internet, self-practicing, going for courses, interning and learning from college. Also serves as a small portfolio for my skills.&#x20;

Here, you can find more information about security-related topics as follows:

* [A basic introduction to Cybersecurity and CTFs](getting-started/ctfs.md)
* [Pentesting Methodologies](broken-reference)
* [Web Security](broken-reference)
* [Networking knowledge + Security](broken-reference)
* [Buffer Overflows](broken-reference)
* [Active Directory ](broken-reference)

**The main bulk of content here are the writeups for HackTheBox and Proving Grounds Practice machines:**

* [HTB](writeups/hackthebox/)
* [Proving Grounds Practice](writeups/proving-grounds-practice/)

This book will be updated as frequently as I can while juggling school work. Check the Updates page to see what I've added (categorised by month) and the To Add page to see what I plan to add.

## Disclaimer

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security or pentesting. I'm just a guy that is really into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you.&#x20;

Please exercise responsibility and keep the law in mind when you are learning and testing on systems. Only test your skills on personal systems, or on systems / platforms where you have the permission to do so.

If I wrote anything wrongly (which I probably did) do submit a PR.&#x20;
