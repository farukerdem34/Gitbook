# Hello!

This is just a compilation of notes and knowledge I gained from scouring the Internet, self-practicing, going for courses, interning and learning from college. Also serves as a small portfolio for my skills.&#x20;

Here, you can find more information about security-related topics as follows:

* [A basic introduction to Cybersecurity and CTFs](getting-started/ctfs.md)
* [Pentesting Methodologies](broken-reference)
* [Web Security](broken-reference)
* [Networking knowledge + Security](broken-reference)
* [Buffer Overflows](broken-reference)
* [Active Directory ](broken-reference)

The main bulk of content here are the writeups for HackTheBox and Proving Grounds Practice machines:

* [HTB](writeups/hackthebox/)
* [Proving Grounds Practice](writeups/proving-grounds-practice/)

**This book will be updated as frequently as I can while juggling school work.**

## Disclaimer

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security or pentesting. I'm just a guy that is into security and wants to learn as much as possible.

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you.&#x20;

Please exercise responsibility and keep the law in mind when you are learning and testing on systems. Only test your skills on personal systems, or on systems where you have the permission to do so.

If I wrote anything wrongly (which I probably did at least once) do let me know!
