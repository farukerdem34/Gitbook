# Emulation

## Environment Creation

In most exercises, there should be some kind of 'range' of which we can run our attacks without affecting the main production environment. This is where the development of a simulated testbed is required.&#x20;

There are many tools that can be used to create this testbed, and these testbeds can be used for other cybersecurity related things such as testing new 0-days on simulated environments to see if your organisation is vulnerable.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is an open-source software project developed by Hashicorp that enables the building and maintaining of portable virtual software development environments.
