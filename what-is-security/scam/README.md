# Scams / Malware

Sometimes, when I get a scam email sent to me with a funny looking link, I open them up in a VM to fuzz it and check what's up.&#x20;

Other times, I get my hands on some malware and really wanna analyse it to see what's going on with the binary. Most of the time, it's quite interesting.&#x20;
