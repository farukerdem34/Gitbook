# Proving Grounds Practice

Proving Grounds Practice writeups here. Separated into either Windows or Linux machines. These machines are generally less 'CTF-ish' relative to HTB machines and they feel similar to Offsec exam machines. They are also a lot shorter.  &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This series of writeups will not be maintained once completed. I'm just transferring my existing old writeups to Gitbook and do not plan on using Proving Grounds after finishing all writeups.&#x20;

(Pending date of completion of all writeups)
