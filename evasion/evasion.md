# Evasion

Will include:

* Processes, Threads, Staged vs Non-staged (inline) payloads, and how does Metasploit really work when we send a Meterpreter payload.&#x20;
* Win32 APIs, registry, and a bit about how Windows vs Linux works and their differences.
* Process Injection, Direct and Indirect syscalls (I am still learning about MockingJay injection)
* AMSI, EDR, AV and MDE stuff (treat all of them like robots with ML incorporated).&#x20;
* Encryption and hiding of shellcode (XOR, .data hiding, UID encryption).&#x20;
